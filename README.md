<p>The previous image-to-image translation such as Pix2Pix learns the mapping between an input image and an output image with a set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training dataset is unavailable. CycleGAN solves this issue by learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples.

<p>UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.
